## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. **We heartily welcome any and all contributions that match our code style standards!**

That being said, this codebase isn't your typical open source project because it's not a library or package with a limited scope â€” it's an entire product.

### Ground Rules

**Contributions and discussion guidelines**

- All discussions agree to GitHub's [Community Guidelines](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-community-guidelines) and [Acceptable Use Policies](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-acceptable-use-policies). We expect discussions in issues and pull requests to stay positive, productive, and respectful.

**Reporting a bug or discussing a feature idea**

- If you found a technical bug or have ideas for features we should implement, open a new issue. Make sure to follow the issue template and you should be golden! ([click here to open a new issue](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v39-toucans-team-01/issues/new/choose))

**Fixing a bug or implementing a new feature**

- If you find a bug and open a PR that fixes it we'll review it as soon as possible to ensure it matches our code style standards.
- If you want to implement a new feature, open an issue first to discuss what it'd look like and to ensure it fits in our roadmap and plans for the app (see [the roadmap](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v39-toucans-team-01/issues) for planned and currently ongoing work).
